### Real Estate Board Game: Machine Learning

A personal project to learn more about machine learning
and its applications by simulating a popular board game with
AI that uses machine learning to make the best plays.

A secondary goal is to analyze the AI decisions and attempt
to find out which big decisions in the game would result in the
highest win-rates.
